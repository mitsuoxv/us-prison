* During 1997 the number of female prisoners rose by 6.2%,
slightly greater than the increase in male prisoners (5.2%).  At
year-end 1997 79,624 women were in State or Federal prisons --
6.4% of all prison inmates.  
 
*  On December 31, 1997, State prisons were operating at between
15% and 24% above capacity, while Federal prisons were operating
at 19% above capacity.

*  California (157,547), Texas (140,729), and the Federal system
(112,973) together held 1 in every 3 prisoners in the Nation. 
Fifteen States, each holding fewer than 5,000 inmates, together
held only 4% of the Nation's prisoners.

*  Nine jurisdictions had increases of at least 10% in 1997, led
by Hawaii (23.4%) and West Virginia (15.4%).  Four
jurisdictions, led by Oregon (down 7.6%) and Montana (-2.2%),
experienced  decreases.

*  Analyses of imprisonment rates from 1990 to 1996, the year of
the latest available data, reveal --

-- a 43% increase among males and a 65% increase among females
in the number of sentenced prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents.

-- sharp increases in rates among persons age 35-39 (up 66%),
40-44 (up 75%), and 45-54 (up 71%).

-- widespread disparities by race and Hispanic origin.  In 1996
the rate among black males totaled 3,098 prisoners per 100,000
residents, compared to 1,278 among Hispanic males and 370 among
white males. 

*  Sources of population growth differed among State inmates:
-- Violent offenders accounted for the largest source of growth
among males (52%) and among whites (46%), blacks (50%), and
Hispanics (54%).
-- Drug offenders accounted for 30% of the growth among blacks,
23% among Hispanics, and 16% among whites.
-- Only among females were drug offenders the largest source of
growth (45% of the total increase).

The total number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of Federal
or State  adult correctional authorities was 1,244,554 at
year-end 1997.  During the year the States and the District of
Columbia added 53,757 prisoners, and the Federal prison system
added 7,429 prisoners.  Overall, the Nation's prison
population grew 5.2%, which was less than the average annual
growth of 7.0% since 1990.  In absolute numbers, prison growth
during 1997 was equivalent to 1,177 more inmates per week, up
from 1,106 per week in 1996. 

At midyear 1997 (the latest available data), more than 1.7
million U.S. residents were in either jail or prison.   State
and Federal prisons housed two-thirds of the incarcerated
population (1,158,763).  Jails, which are locally operated and
typically hold persons awaiting trial and those with sentences
of a year or less, held the other third (567,079).  

Relative to the number of U.S. residents, the rate of
incarceration in prisons at year-end 1997 was 445 sentenced
inmates per 100,000 residents  up from 292 in 1990.  On December
31, 1997, 1 in every 117 men and 1 in every 1,852 women were
sentenced prisoners under the jurisdiction of State or Federal
correctional authorities.

From year-end 1990 to
midyear 1997 --

*  The Nation's incarcerated population rose by more than
577,100 inmates, increasing at an average  annual rate of 6.5%.  

*  State, Federal, and local governments had to accommodate an
additional 88,791 inmates per year (or the equivalent of 1,708
new inmates per week).

*  The rate of incarceration increased from 1 in every 217 U.S.
residents to 1 in every 155.

*  The Nation's prison and local jail facilities added space for
about 541,800 inmates.  By 1997 State prisons were 15% above
their highest capacity; Federal prisons 19% above their rated
capacity; and local jails 3% below their rated capacity.

prison population increased by 61,186 inmates during 1997 -- the
largest increase since 1995 (table 2).  Since 1990 the total
prison population has grown an average of 63,955 per year, for
an overall increase of 470,635 in 7 years.

Prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year ("sentenced
prisoners") represented 96% of the total prison population at
year-end 1997.  During the 12-month period, the sentenced prison
population grew 5.1% (table 3).  The remaining prisoners had
sentences of a year or less or were currently unsentenced (that
is, awaiting trial in States with combined prison-jail systems).

At year-end 1997 U.S. military authorities held 2,772 
prisoners in 64 facilities


About 89% of prisoners held by the Army, Air Force, Navy, and
Marine Corps were convicted inmates;  11% were unconvicted
persons whose cases had not been tried.  Two-thirds of the
prisoners (1,856) had sentences of 1 year or more.

At year-end 1997 the Army's Disciplinary Barracks, Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas, and 6 other local or regional facilities
held more than half (54%) of all inmates under military
jurisdiction. The Navy's 12 facilities held 22% of all inmates;
the Marine Corps' 7 facilities, 21% of all inmates; and the 
Air Force's 38 facilities held fewer than 4% of all inmates.

The operational capacity of the 64 military confinement
facilities totaled 4,483.  At year-end 1997 these facilities were
operating at 62% of their operational capacity.
___________________________________________________

On December 31, 1997, the number of sentenced prisoners per
100,000 U.S. residents was 445.  Of the 11 States with rates
greater than that for the Nation, 7 were in the South, 3 in the
West, and 1 in the Midwest.  Four States -- North Dakota (112),
Minnesota (113), Maine (124), and Vermont (140) -- had rates
that were less than a third of the national rate.  The District
of Columbia, a wholly urban jurisdiction, held 1,682 sentenced
prisoners per 100,000 residents.

Since 1990 the number of sentenced prisoners per 100,000
residents has risen from 292 to 445.  During this period,
incarceration rates rose most in the South (from 316 to 506) and
West (from 277 to 405).  The rate in the Midwest rose from 239
to 346, and the rate in the Northeast grew from 232 to 317.  The
number of sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents
increased from 20 to 35.

---------------------------------------------------
Nine States reported increases of at least 10% during 1997
---------------------------------------------------

Between January 1 and December 31, Hawaii experienced the
largest increase (up 23.4%), followed by West Virginia (15.4%),
Alaska and Maine (13.6%), Vermont (13.5%), Kentucky (13.1%), and
Wisconsin (13.0%).  Three States and the District of Columbia
experienced a decline in prison populations.  Oregon had the
largest decline (down 7.6%), followed by Montana (down 2.2%),
New Mexico (down 0.8%), and the District of Columbia (down 0.2%).

In absolute numbers of inmates, 5 jurisdictions grew by at least
2,000.  California (up 11,498 inmates), experienced the largest 
growth, followed by Texas (up 8,346), the Federal system (up 7,429),
Louisiana (up 2,486), and Michigan (up 2,422).  These five 
jurisdictions, which incarcerated over 40% of all prisoners, 
accounted for 53% of the total growth during 1997.

---------------------------------------------------
Western States recorded the fastest growth
in prison populations
---------------------------------------------------

During 1997 the number of sentenced State and Federal prisoners
grew by an additional 1,127 inmates per week.  The 1997 average
weekly increase was 89 inmates greater than the weekly increase
in 1996 and 187 fewer than in 1995.

The Western States had the highest percentage increase in the 
number of sentenced prisoners, with a gain of 7.0% during 1997.  
The Midwest experienced a rise of 6.2% in the number of sentenced 
prisoners, followed by the South, 4.7%; and the Northeast, 1.6%.

Twenty-three States recorded higher growth rates of sentenced 
prisoners in 1997 than in 1996.  Of these, nine recorded growth 
rates over 10% in 1997, led by Wisconsin (19.0%), West Virginia 
(16.0%), and Hawaii (15.9%).  The District of Columbia (1.7%), 
Virginia (1.7%), and Florida (1.2%) reported increases of less 
than 2% during 1997.  Montana (-2.2%), New Mexico (-1.2%), 
Massachusetts (-0.3%), and North Carolina (-0.1%) experienced 
declines.

Since 1992 the sentenced inmate population in State prisons has 
grown 41.5% (table 4).  During this period nine States reported
increases of at least 50%, led by West Virginia (up 88.8%) and 
Wisconsin (up 83.7%).  Maine was the only State to report an 
increase of less than 10% (up 3.4%).  During this time the 
Federal system reported an increase of 44.6%  29,281 additional 
inmates with sentences of more than 1 year.

Among States, Texas had the highest incarceration 
rate;  North Dakota, the lowest
---------------------------------------------------

At year-end 1997 the 10 jurisdictions with the largest prison
populations had under their jurisdiction 750,815 inmates or 60%
of the Nation's total prison population (table 5).  California
(157,547), Texas (140,729), and the Federal system (112,973)
accounted for a third of the population.  The 10 States with the
smallest prison populations each held fewer than 4,000 inmates. 
Collectively, these States held only 1.8% of the Nation's total
prison population.

Texas had the highest prison incarceration rate (717 sentenced
inmates per 100,000 residents), followed by Louisiana (672),
Oklahoma (617), South Carolina (536), and Mississippi (531). 
Six States had prison incarceration rates below 200, led by
North Dakota (112), Minnesota (113), and Maine (124).

Since 1992, five States had prison population increases of more
than 70%:  West Virginia  (89.5%), Wisconsin (79.2%), Texas
(75.3%), Idaho (74.9%), and Mississippi (73.5%).  Five States --
Michigan (14.5%), South Carolina (13.6%), New York (13.4%),
Maryland (11.3%), and Maine (6.6%) -- had growth of less than
20%.  The District of Columbia (down -14.0%) is the only
jurisdiction to have experienced a decline in the number of
inmates. 

---------------------------------------------------
Female prisoner population 
continues to grow at a fast pace 
---------------------------------------------------

During 1997 the number of women under the jurisdiction of State
or Federal prison authorities increased 6.2%, from 74,970 to
79,624, out pacing the rise in the number of men for the second
consecutive year (table 6).  The number of men grew from
1,108,398 to 1,164,930, an increase of 5.2%.  During 1996 the
number of females grew at nearly double the rate of males (9.5%
compared to 4.8%)

Since 1990 the annual rate of growth of the female inmate
population has averaged 8.8%, higher than the 6.9% average
increase in the number of male inmates.  By year-end 1997 women
accounted for 6.4% of all prisoners nationwide, up from 5.7% 
in 1990. 

Relative to their number in the U.S. resident population, men
were 16 times more likely than women to be incarcerated in a
State or Federal prison.  At year-end 1997 there were 54
sentenced female inmates per 100,000 women in the United States,
compared to 853 sentenced male inmates per 100,000 men.  

Over a third of all female prisoners were held in the three
largest jurisdictions:  California (11,076), Texas (10,549),
and the Federal system (8,306).

Oklahoma (with 121 sentenced female inmates per 100,000 female
State residents) and Texas (with 106) had the highest female
incarceration rates.  Maine (with 9 sentenced female prisoners
per 100,000 female residents), Minnesota and Vermont (with 11),
and Massachusetts (with 14) had the lowest incarceration rates.

Hawaii (10.2%) and Oklahoma (10.0%) had the largest proportion
of women among their  inmates; Maine (3.8%) and Pennsylvania 
(4.0%) had the smallest.

Twenty-eight jurisdictions held fewer than 1,000 female inmates,
accounting for about 13.8% of all female prisoners

---------------------------------------------------
Local jails held almost 34,000
State prisoners because of crowding
---------------------------------------------------

At the end of 1997, 31 States reported a total of 33,736 State
prisoners held in local jails or other facilities because of
crowding in State facilities (table 8).  These inmates held in
local jails represent 3.0% of all State prisoners, up slightly
from 2.9% in 1996.

___________________________________________________

Louisiana and West Virginia had the largest percentage of their
inmate population housed in local jails, 36.9% and 24.4%
respectively.  Four other States -- Arkansas (13.7%), Virginia
(13.2%), New Mexico (11.9%), and New Jersey (10.1%) -- had at
least 10% of their population housed in local jail facilities.

In addition to housing inmates in local jails, 14 States eased
prison crowding by placing inmates in other States or in Federal
facilities.  On December 31, 1997, 5,877 prisoners nationwide
were held under such arrangements -- representing about half of
one percent of all State prisoners.  Colorado placed the most
inmates (1,009), followed by Oklahoma (941), Wisconsin (819),
and Idaho (608).  

Montana (17.0%), Idaho (15.4%), Hawaii (12.1%), and New Mexico
(10.4%) had more than 10% of their prison population housed in
facilities of other States or of the Federal system.

Prison capacity measures vary
---------------------------------------------------

The extent of prison crowding is difficult to determine because
of the absence of uniform measures for defining capacity. 
Jurisdictions apply a variety of capacity measures to reflect
both the available space to house inmates and the ability to
staff and operate an institution.  To estimate the capacity of
their prisons, jurisdictions were asked to supply three measures
for year-end 1997:  rated, operational, and design capacities. 
These measures were defined as follows:

Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by a
rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction.

Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, and
services.

Design capacity is the number of  inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility. Of the 52 reporting
jurisdictions, 33 supplied a rated capacity; 41, an operational
capacity; and 37, a design capacity (table 9).  Twenty-three
jurisdictions provided only 1 measure or the same figure for
each measure they reported.  For the 29 jurisdictions with more
than 1 reported type of capacity, estimates of population as a
percent of capacity are based on the highest and lowest figures
provided.

U.S. Territories held over 15,000 inmates in 1997

The U.S. Territories and Commonwealths -- American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto
Rico, and Virgin Islands -- reported 15,762 inmates under the jurisdiction of their prison
systems at year-end 1997 -- an increase of 11.8% since 1996.  Prisoners with a sentence of more
than 1 year totaled 11,790 (or nearly three-quarters of the total territorial prison population).

Relative to the resident populations in the Territories, the rate of incarceration was 277
prisoners per 100,000 residents -- nearly two-thirds of the combined rate of the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia.  Of the 5 Territories, the Northern Mariana Islands had the lowest prison 
incarceration rate -- 99 inmates per 100,000 residents, followed by American Samoa with 152.  
Puerto Rico with 290 prisoners per 100,000 residents and Guam (with 206) had the highest
incarceration rates.

Puerto Rico, the largest of the Territories, had the most sentenced prisoners (11,097 at year-end
1997), up from 9,934 in 1996.  In 1997, 23 States and the District of Columbia had fewer 
sentenced inmates than Puerto Rico; 17 States had equal or lower incarceration rates.

___________________________________________________


---------------------------------------------------
Most jurisdictions were operating above capacity
---------------------------------------------------

Prisons generally require reserve capacity to operate
efficiently.  Dormitories and cells need to be maintained and
repaired periodically, special housing is needed for protective
custody and disciplinary cases, and space may be needed to cope
with emergencies.

At year-end 1997, 16 States and the District of Columbia reported
that they were operating at or below 99% of their highest
capacity.  Thirty-six States and the Federal prison system
reported operating at 100% or more of their lowest capacity. 
New Mexico, which was operating at 82% of its lowest capacity,
had the least crowded prison system.  California, operating at
over twice its highest reported capacity (206%), had the most
crowded system.

By year-end 1997 the Federal prison system was estimated to be
operating at 19% over capacity, decreasing since year-end 1996
(25%).  Overall, State prisons were estimated to be operating at
15% above their highest capacity, down slightly from the 16% for
last year (table 10).  Based on the lowest capacity figures,
State prisons were operating at 24% over capacity at year-end
1997, continuing the steady decline from 31% in 1991.

*Based on adjusted NPS counts.

Between 1990 and 1996 the number of prisoners with sentences of
more than 1 year rose by more than 396,800 -- or 54% (table 11).
The number of white males increased by 46%, the number of black
males by 55%, the number of white females by 67%, and the number
of black females by 72%.  At year-end 1996 (the latest available
data), there were more black males in State or Federal prisons
(528,200) than white males (510,900).

Note:  Sentenced prisoners are those with a sentence 
of more than 1 year.  The total number of Hispanic inmates
was estimated in each year by multiplying the percent 
identifying as Hispanic in the 1991 and 1997 surveys 
by the NPS sentenced inmate counts.  Estimates have 
been rounded to the nearest 100.  
___________________________________________________

Previously published numbers by race have been revised to take
into account the racial identification of Hispanic inmates that
some State prison authorities classified as persons of an
unknown race.  In some previous publications the reported racial
distribution was used to estimate the race of inmates with
unknown race.  In recent years, as the number of Hispanic
inmates with unknown race increased, this procedure has
overestimated the number of black inmates.

Revised estimates have been produced for 1990 through 1996 by
combining data from the NPS series and data from State prison
inmate surveys conducted in 1991 and 1997.  Estimates were
obtained by first summing the numbers of Hispanic inmates among
States that reported Hispanics as having an unknown race.
The racial distribution of these inmates was then calculated
using the racial self-identifications provided by Hispanic
inmates in the prisoner surveys.

(for whom race was unknown) was then calculated using the
combined distribution of all inmates for whom data on race was
reported.

*Based on data from the 1991 and 1997 surveys

The Nation's prison population is aging.  Based on preliminary
data from the 1997 surveys of State and Federal prison inmates,
30% were between the ages of 35 and 44, compared with 23% in
1991.  This rise was offset by a decline in the percentage of
inmates 18 to 35.  The percentage of inmates age 55 or older did
not change -- about 3% in both years.  Nearly half of one
percent were under age 18 in 1997, unchanged from 1991.

---------------------------------------------------
Incarceration rates have risen
sharply among older age groups,
women,  and minorities
---------------------------------------------------

Relative to the number of U.S. residents, the rate of
incarceration in State and Federal prison rose sharply between
1990 and 1996.  At year-end 1996, there were 422 sentenced
inmates per 100,000 residents -- up from 292 in 1990 (table 13).
Overall, the prison incarceration rate rose 45% in 6 years.

___________________________________________________

Incarceration rates rose the sharpest among older age groups. 
Between 1990 and 1996, the number of prisoners per 100,000
residents increased 66% among persons age 35 to 39; 75% among
persons 40 to 44; and 71% among persons 45 to 54.  

Relative to their number in the U.S. resident population, the
number of men in prison grew more slowly than the number of
women.  During the 6-year period, the female prison
incarceration rate rose 65% (from 31 per 100,000 to 51) while
the male rate rose 43% (from 564 to 809).  Among women age 35 to
54, these rates doubled.

In 1990 and 1996 non-Hispanic blacks were about twice as likely
as Hispanics and nearly 8 times more likely than non-Hispanic
whites to be in State or Federal prison.  At year-end 1996 there
were 1,571 sentenced black inmates per 100,000 blacks in the
United States, compared to 688 sentenced Hispanic inmates per
100,000 Hispanics and 193 white inmates per 100,000 whites.  For
some age groups, the racial and ethnic disparities were even
larger: among persons age 25 to 29, an estimated 4.1% of blacks
were in prison in 1996, compared to 1.5% of Hispanics and 0.4%
of whites. 

---------------------------------------------------
An estimated 7% of black males in their twenties and
thirties were in prison in 1996
---------------------------------------------------

When incarceration rates are estimated separately for men and
women, black males in their twenties and thirties are found to
have very high rates relative to other groups (table 14). 
Expressed in terms of percentages, 8.3% of black males age 25 to
29 were in prison in 1996, compared to 2.6% of Hispanic males
and about 0.8% of white males in the same age group.  Although
incarceration rates drop with age, the percentage of black males
age 45 to 54 in prison in 1996 was still nearly 2.8% --
equivalent to the highest rate among Hispanic males (age 20 to
24) and more than 3 times larger than the highest rate (0.9%)
among white males (age 30 to 34).

Female incarceration rates, though substantially lower than male
incarceration rates at every age, reveal similar racial and
ethnic disparities. Black females (with an incarceration rate of
188 per 100,000) were more than twice as likely as Hispanic
females (78 per 100,000) and 8 times more likely than white
females (23 per 100,000) to be in prison in 1996.  These differences
among white, black, and Hispanic females were consistent across all
age groups.

---------------------------------------------------
Growth linked to increasing number of inmates in State prison
for violent and drug offenses
---------------------------------------------------

Between 1990 and 1996 the distribution of the four major offense
categories -- violent, property, drug, and public-order offenses
-- did not change among State prisoners.

In absolute numbers, however, the largest growth in State
inmates was among violent offenders.  Between 1990 and 1996 the
number of violent offenders grew 179,500, while the number of
drug offenders grew 87,900 (table 15).  As a percentage of the
total growth, violent offenders accounted for 50% of the total
growth, drug offenders 25%, property offenders 18%, and
public-order offenders 7%.

Detailed estimates of the State inmates at year-end 1990 and 1996
reveal differences in the sources of growth among male and
female inmates.  During the  period the number of female inmates
serving time for drug offenses doubled, while the number of male
inmates in for drug offenses rose 55%.  The number serving time
for violent offenses, however, rose at about the same pace (up
57% for men and 58% for women).

---------------------------------------------------

Estimates of the offense distributions of State inmates also
reveal differences in the sources of population growth among
white, black, and Hispanic prisoners (table 16).  Between 1990
and 1996 the number of black inmates serving time for drug
offenses increased from 79,800 to 133,400 (an increase of 67%),
while the number of white inmates held for drug offenses 
increased from 29,600 to 46,300 (up 56%) and the number of
Hispanic inmates held for drug offenses increased from 38,700
to 52,300 (up 35%).  The number of violent offenders also rose
more sharply among black inmates (up 60%)and Hispanic inmates
(up 74%)than among white inmates (up 42%).

Changing Federal prison 
population related to drug and
weapons violations
---------------------------------------------------

Prisoners sentenced for drug offenses constituted the largest
group of Federal inmates (60%) in 1996, up from 53% in 1990
(table 18). On September 30, 1996, the date of the latest
available data, Federal prisons held 55,194 sentenced drug
offenders, compared to 31,300 at year-end 1990.  Between 1990 and
1996 the percentage of violent Federal inmates declined from 18%
to 12%.  As a percentage of all Federal inmates, robbers showed
the largest decline, from 12% to 9%.

___________________________________________________

During the period, the number of Federal inmates held for
weapons and immigration offenses more than doubled.  The number
of weapons offenders rose from 3,234 in 1990 to 7,480 in 1996;
immigration offenders rose from 1,645  to 4,476.  By September
30, 1996, weapon offenders represented 8.1% of Federal inmates
and immigration violators 4.8%.

As a consequence of the dramatic growth in the number of drug
offenders, an increasing percentage of Federal prisoners are
black or Hispanic.  Between 1990 and 1996, the percent black
among Federal inmates rose from 30% to 38%, while the percent
white declined from 38% to 30% and the percent Hispanic remained
unchanged (about 28%). 
 
As a percent of the total growth, drug offenses accounted for a
greater share of the increases among black inmates (82%) than
among Hispanic (67%) or white inmates (65%) (table 19). 
Overall,  black and Hispanic inmates accounted for
three-quarters of the total increase in Federal inmates.

---------------------------------------------------
 
National Prisoner Statistics (NPS)
---------------------------------------------------

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), with the U.S. Bureau of
the Census as its collection agent, obtains year-end and midyear
counts of prisoners from departments of correction in each of
the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Bureau
of Prisons.  In an effort to collect comparable data from all
jurisdictions, NPS distinguishes prisoners in custody from
those under jurisdiction.  To have custody of a prisoner, a
State must hold that person in one of its facilities.  To have
jurisdiction means that a State has legal authority over the
prisoner.  Prisoners under a State's jurisdiction may be in the
custody of a local jail, another State's prison, or other
correctional facility.  Some States are unable to provide both
custody and jurisdiction counts.  (See NPS jurisdiction notes.)

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined in locally
administered confinement facilities who are under the
jurisdiction of local authorities.  NPS counts include all
inmates in State-operated facilities in Alaska, Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which have combined
jail-prison systems.

Military Corrections Statistics
---------------------------------------------------

BJS obtains year-end counts of  prisoners in the custody of U.S.
military authorities from the Department of Defense Corrections
Council.  In 1994 the council, comprised of representatives from
each branch of military service, adopted a standardized
report(DD Form 2707)  with a common set of items and
definitions.  This report provides information on persons held
in U.S. military confinement facilities inside and outside the
continental United States, by branch of service, sex, race, and
Hispanic origin, conviction status and sentence length, and
offense.  It also includes data on the number of facilities, and
their design and rated capacities. 

Before 1997 all services except the Air Force submitted these
reports annually.  Information on prisoners held in Air Force
facilities was reported for the first time in 1997.  

Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities
---------------------------------------------------

The Surveys of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional
Facilities, which BJS conducts regularly every 5 to 6 years,
provide detailed data on individual characteristics of prison
inmates.  Based on scientifically selected samples of facilities
and of inmates held in them, these surveys provide detailed
information unavailable from any other source.  (See Harlow,
Comparing Federal and State Prison Inmates, 1991, NCJ 145864,
for a description of the 1991 surveys, sample designs, and
accuracy.) 

For this report, information on sex, race/Hispanic origin, age,
and offense were drawn from the 1991 surveys. Preliminary data
from the 1997 surveys were used to estimate changes since 1991. 
Publications from the 1997 surveys are expected to be released
in late 1998 or early 1999.  
 
Estimating age-specific incarceration rates
---------------------------------------------------

The number of sentenced prisoners within each age group was
estimated for men, women, whites, blacks, and Hispanics. 
Estimates for 1990 and 1996 were produced by combining data from
NPS and from the State and Federal prison inmate surveys.  The
following procedures were used:

1. To obtain estimates of the number of sentenced State and
Federal inmates by sex,  race, and Hispanic origin in each year,
NPS custody counts for men and women were used.  These counts of
State and Federal inmates were multiplied by the proportion
white, black, Hispanic, or other race as estimated from the
State and Federal inmate surveys in each year.  The estimates
were then adjusted to equal the number of sentenced inmates by
sex in State and Federal prisons as reported in NPS for year-end
1990 and 1996. 

2. To obtain estimates by age in each year, age distributions
for each demo-graphic group were drawn from the State and
Federal prison inmate surveys.  These percentages were then
multiplied by the number of sentenced inmates for each group
defined by sex, race, and Hispanic origin.

3. Estimates of the U.S. resident population for July 1, 1990,
and 1996, were obtained from the U.S. Bureau 
of the Census.  (See U.S. Population estimates, by Age, Sex,
Race, and Hispanic Origin: 1990 to 1995, PPL-41, and update for
1996.)  These data were then adjusted for the 1990 decennial
census, using the 1990 Post Enumeration Survey.  

4. Age-specific rates of incarceration  for each demographic
group were calculated by dividing the estimated number of
sentenced prisoners in each age group by the number of U.S.
residents in each age group and then multiplying by 100,000.

Estimating offense distributions 
--------------------------------------------------- 

The offense distributions of State prisoners were also estimated
by combining data from the 1986, 1991, and 1997 State prison
inmate surveys, counts by offense of annual admissions and
releases in the National Corrections Reporting Program  (NCRP,
1986-96), and NPS data for 1990 and 1996.  The following
procedures were used:

1.  The total number of sentenced prisoners under State
jurisdiction in 1990 by offense was estimated using the forward
and backward stock-flow procedures, as outlined in Prisoners in
1996 (NCJ-164619).  The offense distributions for each year
through 1996 were derived from the NCRP using the forward
estimation procedures only.  In each year estimates of the
number of inmates by offense were calculated by adding all
admissions and subtracting all releases from the base population
of the previous year.  The estimated end-of-year distribution
was then used as the base for the next year.  This procedure was
repeated for each year through 1996.

2.  Within each offense category, the distribution by sex, race,
and Hispanic origin were obtained from the 1991 and 1997 State
inmate surveys.  These percents were then multiplied by the
estimated total number in each offense category in 1990 and 1996.

3.  Final estimates were obtained  through an iterative process
so that the estimated numbers for men and women equaled the
number of sentenced inmates reported in NPS in each year.  

NPS jurisdiction notes

Tennessee -- Rated capacity is the total beds available based on
the original design plus any modifications.  Operational
capacity is defined as the percent of total beds deemed
appropriate by the Department of Corrections.

Population counts of inmates with a maximum sentence of more
than 1 year include an undetermined number of inmates with a
sentence of 1 year or less.

Texas -- Population counts of inmates with a maximum sentence of
more than 1 year include an undetermined number of inmates with

1997, limiting responsibility to those with a sentence of 1 year
or more.

Rated, operational, and design capacity figures are calculated
using the base capacity method in which only the bunks that
touch the floor are counted.  Top bunks are excluded. 

Washington -- Reported capacities exclude work release and
pre-release facilities, because the facilities are not reserved
specifically for State inmates.
