"b/Due to differences in the dates when data were extracted, the federal custody count reported for the calculation of capacity excludes 3,990 inmates compared to the yearend custody data reported in the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS). ",,,,,,,,,,,
c/State defines capacity in a way that differs from BJS’s definition. See Jurisdiction notes.,,,,,,,,,,,
d/Alaska did not report 2014 capacity or custody population data to NPS. Estimates derived from a report to the state legislature. See Methodology.,,,,,,,,,,,
e/Private facilities included in capacity and custody counts.,,,,,,,,,,,
f/Both capacity and custody counts exclude inmates in community-based work release facilities.,,,,,,,,,,,
g/State did not report 2014 capacity counts to NPS. Data are from 2013.,,,,,,,,,,,
h/Capacity counts include institution and camp net operating capacities and the population of community programs on December 31 because these programs do not have a fixed capacity.,,,,,,,,,,,
"i/State has changed reporting methodology, so 2014 capacity counts are not comparable to those published for earlier years. See Jurisdiction notes.",,,,,,,,,,,
