"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Counts exclude transfers, escapes, and absences without leave (AWOLs). Counts include other conditional release violators, returns from appeal or bond, and other admissions. See Methodology. Counts cover January 1 through December 31 for each year and are based on prisoners admitted to state or federal correctional authorities with a sentence of more than 1 year. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Multiple states reported large changes in prison populations, admissions, and releases between 2019 and 2020 due to criminal justice reforms enacted to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Because these differences were not the result of changes in reporting methods, BJS made direct comparisons of 2019 and 2020 data, understanding that the criminal justice reforms may be temporary.",,,,,,,,,,
