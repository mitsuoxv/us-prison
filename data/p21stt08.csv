"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Counts exclude transfers, escapes, and absences without leave (AWOLs). Counts include other conditional release violators, returns from appeal or bond, and other admissions. See Methodology. Counts cover January 1 through December 31 for each year and are based on prisoners admitted to state or federal correctional authorities with a sentence of more than 1 year. As of December 31, 2001, persons sentenced for a felony in the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. ",,,,,,,,,,
