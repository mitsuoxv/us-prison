"Note: Excludes inmates held in local jails, other states, or private facilities, unless otherwise stated. Rated capacity is the number of inmates or beds a facility can hold set by a rating official; operational capacity is the number of inmates a facility can hold based on staffing and services; and design capacity is the number of inmates a facility can hold set by the architect or planner. Lowest capacity represents the minimum capacity estimate submitted by the jurisdiction, while highest capacity represents the maximum capacity estimate. When a jurisdiction could provide only a single capacity estimate, it was used as both lowest and highest capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,
…Not available. Specific type of capacity is not measured by state.,,,,,,,,,,,
/Not reported.,,,,,,,,,,,
"a/Due to differences in the dates when data were extracted, the federal custody count reported for the calculation of capacity differs slightly from the year-end custody count reported in the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS). It includes prisoners of all sentence lengths.",,,,,,,,,,,
b/State defines capacity differently than BJS does. See Jurisdiction notes.,,,,,,,,,,,
c/Alaska’s capacity excludes non-traditional confinement such as halfway houses or electronic monitoring.,,,,,,,,,,,
d/Private facilities included in capacity and custody counts.,,,,,,,,,,,
e/Hawaii’s custody count excludes 248 offenders who were relocated out-of-state while an in-state facility was being repaired.,,,,,,,,,,,
"f/Illinois’s rated capacity is under revision, and these numbers are the ceiling operational capacity. Numbers are not comparable to prior reports.",,,,,,,,,,,
g/Indiana’s capacity includes facilities owned by the state but staffed with employees of a private correctional company.,,,,,,,,,,,
h/Maryland’s capacity may include some pre-trial detainees excluded from the custody count.,,,,,,,,,,,
i/Local facilities are included in Mississippi’s capacity and custody counts.,,,,,,,,,,,
"j/State did not submit 2017 NPS data on custody or capacity. Custody count was imputed, and capacities were assumed to have not changed from the most recent year the state submitted NPS data. See Methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,
